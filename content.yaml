      title: "Our lab manual is now open source!"
      description: |
        <p>We are excited to announce that the Rendeiro Lab Manual is now open source and accessible to all.</p>
        <p>This comprehensive guide details our lab's culture, procedures, and workflows, aiming to foster a collaborative and efficient research environment. You can explore the manual on our website: <a href="https://rendeiro.group/lab-manual">https://rendeiro.group/lab-manual</a></p>
        <p>Our decision to make this manual open source was inspired by the generosity of other labs that have shared their resources. In particular, we acknowledge the Aly Lab and the Getz Lab for their open-source manuals, which served as valuable references in developing our own.</p>
        <p>We envision this manual as a living document, evolving with contributions from the broader scientific community. By sharing our practices and protocols, we hope to promote transparency and collaboration in research. We invite you to explore, utilize, and contribute to the manual, ensuring it remains a dynamic and valuable resource for all.</p>
        <p>The manual is hosted on GitHub, where you can access the source code and even propose changes:  <a href="https://github.com/rendeirolab/lab-manual">https://github.com/rendeirolab/lab-manual</a></p>
        <p>We are curious on the reaction and feedback from the research community, please reach out to us.</p>

      title: "Our manuscript on the prediction of biological age from histopathological insights is now online!"
      description: |
        <p>
        Our study reveals focuses on the structural changes human tissues undergo during aging and how they reflect its physiological state.
        </p>
        <p>
        By analyzing over 25,000 histopathological images across various tissues from nearly 1,000 individuals, we developed 'tissue clocks' that can estimate biological age based on tissue morphological characteristics.
        We found that aging manifests differently in various organs, some showing accelerated changes early in life. Conversely, some individuals show markedly more accceleated aging than others, sometimes in a organ-specific manner.
        Leveraging these tissue-specific and highly physiological readouts of aging, we demonstrate how we can derive the a proxy for tissue-specific, morphologically driven biological age from blood samples and validate them in diseased samples.
        </p>
        <p>This study highlights the intricate relationship between tissue health and biological aging, and could revolutionize the way we assess and understand the biological processes leading to aging-related diseases.</p>

        <p>The official acceptance into the <a href="https://scverse.org">scverse</a> ecosystem will enable scientists from all backgrounds but in particular from the single-cell and genomics fields which are already using scverse tools to seemlessly work with WSIs as if it were any other single-cell type of data.</p>

      title: "Our manuscript on the prediction of biological age from histopathological insights is now online!"
      description: |
        <p>
          Our study reveals focuses on the structural changes human tissues undergo during aging and how they reflect its physiological state.
        </p>
        <p>
        By analyzing over 25,000 histopathological images across various tissues from nearly 1,000 individuals, we developed 'tissue clocks' that can estimate biological age based on tissue morphological characteristics.
        We found that aging manifests differently in various organs, some showing accelerated changes early in life. Conversely, some individuals show markedly more accceleated aging than others, sometimes in a organ-specific manner.
        Leveraging these tissue-specific and highly physiological readouts of aging, we demonstrate how we can derive the a proxy for tissue-specific, morphologically driven biological age from blood samples and validate them in diseased samples.
        </p>
        <p>This study highlights the intricate relationship between tissue health and biological aging, and could revolutionize the way we assess and understand the biological processes leading to aging-related diseases.</p>

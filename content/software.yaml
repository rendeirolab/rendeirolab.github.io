    LazySlide:
      title: "LazySlide"
      subtitle: "Modular and scalable whole slide image analysis"
      description: |
        LasySlide is a Python library for processing whole slide images (WSI) analysis.
        It provides a simple interface to perform robust preprocessing and advanced analysis for WSIs.

    WSIData:
      title: "WSIData"
      subtitle: "Efficient data structures and IO operations for whole slide images analysis"
      description: |
        WSIData is a data structure for manipulating whole slide images (WSI) and storing its analysis results in Python.
        It can read a variety of WSI formats and it inherits directly from <a href='https://spatialdata.scverse.org/'>SpatialData</a>, making it interoperable with <a href='https://scverse.org/'>the scverse ecosystem</a>.
        wsidata is designed to used with LazySlide.

      subtitle: "Python library for processing whole slide images (WSI)"
      description: |
        A simple Python library for processing whole slide images (WSI) with an object-oriented interface.
        It has the goal of doing basic processing of WSIs with reasonable defaults, but high customizability.
        It is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM">the "CLAM" repository from the Mahmood lab</a>.
